Objective:
Create and configure multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) using VirtualBox, establish a network between them, and deploy a microservice-based application across the connected VMs.

Deliverables:


1. Document Report:
    Step-by-Step Instructions for Implementation:
    Installation of VirtualBox and creation of multiple VMs.
    Configuration of network settings to connect the VMs.
    Deployment of a simple microservice application (e.g., a RESTful API or a Node.js-based service) across the VMs.

2. Architecture Design:
    Diagram showing the connection of VMs and their roles in hosting the microservice application.

3. Link to Source Code Repo:
    GitHub or similar repository containing the source code of the microservice application and deployment configuration.
